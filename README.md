# Gameplay
You play as Sneky! He's hungry and wants apples. You as Sneky, have to help him.  
Currently, the game has 6 modes.
## Classic
It's just... Snake. Sneky will die if he bumps into himself or hit the border.
## Apple Bag
Multiple apples are spawning! Will Sneky eat them or be hungry?
## Portal Border
The border turns into a portal to go to the other side of the playfield!
## Ultimate Mode
Sneky switches color and power every time you collect **a certain amount of apples**. Let's use Sneky's powers to win!
## Angry Apple
**You** are an angry apple! You're tired of Sneky eating all of your apple friends, so you try to escape him by running out of the playfield!  
If you escape Sneky, you get 1 point and be spawned somewhere else, but Sneky will recieve power. If he eats you, you die and lose. If he dies, you win!
## De Snake Mode
The *Debug* Mode of Sneky. Like cheating? This is for you! Sneky can now walk through himself, turn around, and walk through the portal borders!
## How to win
To win in a mode (except for Angry Apple), you must somehow fill the entire screen with yourself so that **no apples remain on-screen**!

# Game Features
## Mode Unlocking
To unlock the next mode, you have to reach 20 points in the previous mode. To unlock De Snake Mode, you must play the Ultimate Snake mode until Sneky changes color to **Ultra Instinct White** (see below).  
After unlocking De Snake Mode, you gain access to 2 debugging features: Turbo Mode and the AI Snake.
## Debugging Features
To unlock these features, you must unlock De Snake Mode first.
### Turbo Mode
Sneky's speed is 0% at first, which is VERY slow. Normally, eating an apple makes him speed up by *a little bit*.  
But that's slow, right? Hold down the Turbo key (default: LCTRL) to speed Sneky up to max speed until you lift the key!  
In Angry Apple mode, this slows down the apple and Sneky to about 33%, making escaping Sneky easier.
### AI Snake
Press the AI Snake key (default: X) to turn on AI Snake mode. In this mode, Sneky will control himself. He's not that good, but he gets the job done. A red square will also appear above the apple Sneky is targeting. Press the AI Snake key again to regain control of Sneky.  
Keep in mind: As you play as an apple in Angry Apple mode, you can't gain control of Sneky!
## Sneky's Colors
Sneky has different colors, and that represents different powers.
- **Green**: The plain 'ol snake that dies when bumping into borders or itself.
- **Super Yellow**: Makes more apples spawn.
- **God Red**: Allows Sneky to turn around and go past himself.
- **Light Blue**: Makes the borders act as portals to the other side of the playfield.
- **Ultra Instinct White**: Sneky becomes so fast that the border completely breaks, allowing him to go outside of the playfield. You can easily lose track of Sneky if he goes off-screen. Ultimate Mode only.
## Miscellaneous
### Key Rebinding
Yup, that's right!!! You didn't expect this, right? You wouldn't think a game coming from GitHub wouldn't have key rebinding, right?  
Well, you can say it's very unnecessary, but who cares?  
In case you have one of your keys broken, especially if it's required to play Sneky (like the ESC key, you can rebind the key to a non-broken key!
Just go to Settings > Controls, and you can rebind any key you want. This can also be helpful if you wanna change up the controls, e.g. you prefer WASD to move (the default move keys are the arrow keys).
### Themes
Every time you load up Sneky, it checks the date to load the theme. For example, on December 24th, Sneky loads the Christmas theme!  
You can't change the game theme from within the game, though. What you can do to change the game theme is to change the date on your computer or modify the code!
### Splashes
On top of the logo is a splash that changes almost every time you start Sneky.  
What text it will show depends on RNG, the game theme, and the date.
